# Dall-eAPI
A web page of my own design that uses Dall-e 2 API to create AI generated images.

I am still working on the second page of this project. In which the user will be able to upload a picture and change the image's background using AI.
To achieve that, I'll be using APIs to DALL-E and a backgroung eraser.
